spam-filter
===========

Common Lisp implementation to Clojure in Spam Filter

Spam-filter is [Clojure](http://clojure.org) library for spam-filtering. It is based by PCL (Practical Common Lisp)'s [Chapter 23 - Practical: A Spam Filter](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-a-spam-filter.html) and [Stuart halloway's practical-cl-clojure](https://github.com/stuarthalloway/practical-cl-clojure). But detailed implementation is quite different.
